# [Copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty) in Action

## Introduction

[copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty) according to its documentation is:

> Portable file server with accelerated resumable uploads, dedup, WebDAV, FTP, zeroconf, media indexer, thumbnails++ all in one file, no deps 

Here I provided configuration and a docker-compose to run it whenever and wherever I need it.
